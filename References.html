				<h2> Absolute References</h2>

				<p> Absolute references (sometimes called external links), connects to pages in other domains. In the href attricbute of the tag, the full URL of the page, image, or other resource you would like to link to is specified. One example might be your quest to list some of the greatest bakeries of all time. Since you want to link to the bakeries themselves and not files you wrote, you would use an absolute refence.</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://tartinebakery.com"> Tartine in San Francisco, USA.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="https://en.hafizmustafa.com"> Hafiz Mustafa, Istanbul</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129743-d1692532-Reviews-Patisserie_Sadaharu_Aoki_Paris_Tokyo_Midtown-Akasaka_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefect.html"> Patisserie Sadaharu</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="https://macrinabakery.com"> Macrina Bakery and Cafe, Seattle.</a></li>
					<br>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p> An advantage of absolute references is that you are always linked to the most up-to-date information on that page. A disadvantage however, is that it is up to you to make sure that the links do not change.</p>

				<h2> Relative References</h2>

				<p> Relative references (sometimes called internal links), connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag, only the folder (if any) and filename is specified. Some examples of when you might use relative references would be in your navigation bar or links to your image</p>
