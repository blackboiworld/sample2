		<div id="Absolute">
				<h2> Absolute References</h2>
				<p> Absolute references (sometimes called external links), connects to pages in other domains. In the href attricbute of the tag, the full URL of the page, image, or other resource you would like to link to is specified. One example might be your quest to list some of the greatest bakeries of all time. Since you want to link to the bakeries themselves and not files you wrote, you would use an absolute refence.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://tartinebakery.com"> Tartine in San Francisco, USA.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="https://en.hafizmustafa.com"> Hafiz Mustafa, Istanbul</a></li>

					<br>
					<li><a href="https://macrinabakery.com"> Macrina Bakery and Cafe, Seattle.</a></li>
					<br>
				</ul>
				<p> An advantage of absolute references is that you are always linked to the most up-to-date information on that page. A disadvantage however, is that it is up to you to make sure that the links do not change.</p>

				<h2> Relative References</h2>

				<p> Relative references (sometimes called internal links), connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag, only the folder (if any) and filename is specified. Some examples of when you might use relative references would be in your navigation bar or links to your image</p>

		<center><h1>Some common Block Tags</h1></center>
	</header>
	<h2> hr</h2>
	<p> The &lthr> element used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still how it is typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning, "semantic break." I will be using it often to break up example files when I want to display multiple tags in one file.</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Address</h2>
	<p> The &ltaddress> element indicates that the text is an address specific to the page, perhaps contact information for the author</p>
	<address>1, Aro street</address>
	<address>Ilogbo - Elegba</address>
	<address>Ojo, Lagos state.</address>
	<address>102110.</address><br>

	<hr>
	<h2> Blockquote</h2>
	<p> The &ltblockquote> element is used for extended quotations. it should include the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.</p>
	<blockquote>"If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way." <cite>Napolean Hills.</cite></blockquote><br>

	<hr>
	<h2> details</h2>
	<p> The &ltdetails> element is used in conjunction with the &ltsummary> tag. It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeated use of scripting to open and close content. It is not supported by all the browsers yet though.</p>
	<details>
		<summary>The summary</summary>
		<p>The rest of the details content goes here. If only &ltdetails> element is not supported, then the summary and the content are always visible.</p>
	</details><br>

	<header>
		<center><h1>Inline Elements</h1></center>
	</header>
	<p>
		Why do we bother with inline elements? There are certainly times we want to mark up content, but we do not want to insert the line breaks around them. The &ltspan> tag was the first to give you that ability, but it was mostly used to style the code, and we do not want to do that. Some of the newer tags that still separate content ans style are listed below. Remember, Inline tags can flow next to each other and do not cause a line break before and after the element. we have seen this with links and images.
	</p>

	<h2>Citing a source - cite</h2>
	<p> The &ltcite> makes it more easier for people and bots to search the code for this specific information.</p>
	<P><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</P><br>
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_cite.asp"> Using the cite tag in HTML5.</a><hr>
	<h2> Defining your abbreviations - abbr</h2>
	<p> The &ltabbr> will display an abbreviation on the browser. But if a tile attribute is specified in the tag, the title will appear whenthe mouse hovers over the abbreviation. Screen readers also provide the title information.</p>
	<p>The days of the week are often abbreviated: <abbr title="Sunday">Sun,</abbr><abbr title="Monday"> Mon,</abbr><abbr title="Tuesday"> Tues</abbr> etc.</p>

	<h2>Specifying the use of time - time</h2>
	<p> The &lttime> tag is again a completely semantic tag that can be used to search for specific information.</p>
	<p>The party starts at <time>9:00pm</time> and ends at <time>12:00am.</time></p>
	<p>The party took place on <time>New Year's Eve.</time></p>

	<h2> Identifying code fragments - code</h2>
	<p> The &ltcode> element tends to be displayed in a different font, but also has the semantic meaning to convey information to as many people as possible.</p>
	<P>I have been trying to learn how to write html but my <code>img</code> element never seem to work.</P>
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp"> Using the code tag in HTML5.</a><hr>
	<h2>Using Subscripts and Superscripts - sub and sup</h2>
	<p>The &ltsub> and &ltsup> elements are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g (x+y)<sup>3</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O. But images did not convey the same meaning to all users.</p>
