				<h2>Absolute References</h2>

				<p> Absolute references (sometimes called external links) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag, the full URL of the page, image, or other resource you would like to link to is specified. One example might be your quest to list some of the greatest bakeries of all time. since you want to link to the bakeries themselves and not files that you wrote, you would use an absolute reference.</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.washtenawdairy.com/">Washtenaw Diary</a></li>
					<br><li><a href="http://www.thedexterbakery.com/">The Dexter Bakery</a></li>
					<br><li><a href="http://www.rosiesbakery.com/">Rosie's Coffee Bar and Bakery</a></li>
					</ul>
				<p> An advantage of absolute reference is that you are always linked to the most up-to-date information on that page. A disadvantage is that it is up to you to make sure that the links don't change.</p>
